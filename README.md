Project Title: Danny's Diner Customer Analysis and Loyalty Program

**Project Description:**

The "Danny's Diner Customer Analysis and Loyalty Program" project is a comprehensive database management and analysis system designed to provide insights into customer behavior, preferences, and loyalty at Danny's Diner, a fictional restaurant. The project involves creating and populating a database, writing SQL queries, and presenting meaningful results to help the restaurant make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences and loyalty.

**Key Features:**

1. **Database Setup:** The project begins by creating the "dannys_diner" database and defining three main tables: "members," "menu," and "sales." These tables store information about customers, menu items, and sales transactions.

2. **Data Population:** The database is populated with sample data, including customer profiles, menu items, and sales transactions. This data represents customer interactions with the restaurant over time.

3. **Customer Analysis:** A series of SQL queries are written to extract valuable insights from the database:

   - **Total Spending:** The project calculates the total amount spent by each customer at the restaurant.
   
   - **Days Visited:** It determines the number of days each customer has visited the restaurant.
   
   - **First Purchase:** The first item purchased by each customer after joining the restaurant's loyalty program is identified.
   
   - **Popular Menu Item:** The most purchased item on the menu and the number of times it was ordered by all customers are displayed.
   
   - **Customer's Favorite Item:** The most popular menu item for each customer is determined based on the number of purchases.
   
   - **First Purchase After Joining:** The first item purchased by each customer after becoming a member is identified.
   
   - **Last Purchase Before Joining:** The item purchased just before each customer became a member is displayed.
   
   - **Total Spending Before Joining:** The total items purchased and the amount spent by each customer before becoming a member are calculated.
   
   - **Points Calculation:** Points earned by each customer based on their spending are computed, with special consideration for sushi items and loyalty program initiation.

   - **Points Calculation with Initial Bonus:** Points earned by each customer during the first week of joining, with a special bonus, are determined.

4. **Table Output Recreation:** The project generates a table output that showcases customer purchases, order dates, product names, prices, and whether the customer was a member at the time of purchase.

**Project Benefits:**

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The project offers valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling the restaurant to make informed decisions regarding menu adjustments, promotions, and loyalty programs.

- **Customer Engagement:** By identifying customer preferences and popular menu items, the restaurant can tailor its offerings to increase customer satisfaction and engagement.

- **Loyalty Program Enhancement:** The project's loyalty program insights can help the restaurant refine its loyalty program structure, bonus points, and special offers.

- **Performance Measurement:** The project helps monitor customer visits, spending trends, and popular items, facilitating ongoing performance evaluation and strategic planning.
